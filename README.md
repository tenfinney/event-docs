# Start: Go to Voxels.com

No username or password is required in Voxels. You can tour the metaverse world completely anonymously. If you would like to participate and play for prizes/rewards you will need a Web3 account connected to Voxels. There does not need to be any tokens or money in the account to play the standard games but the account will need to be connected to Voxels. 

This is done by signing a cryptographic message only you could sign. You can learn more [here]((https://metamask.io/))  <img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/sign-in.png" width="200">


## Game Tip: 

This image <img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/animate.gif" width="50">  links you back to the Web3Skills Hub where you will be able to fast travel to any location use in the quests and events. Use it often if you need to go back and start your quest again. <img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/citywalk-royal0-tr.png" height="50"> <img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/024.png" height="50"> Citywalk 24 is where all the quest games start. 

You can find it on the directory <img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/Web3Skills-hub-directory.png" width="300"> in the [Web3Skills Hub]((https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=SE@263E,6S)) parcel.


## Before you start.

In Voxels, if you want to turn off the sound right click your browser tab and Mute the site.
<img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/audio-mixer-icon-voxels.png" width="50">

If you want to adjust the audio, sounds, and chat first select the audio mixer and then you will use the audio mixer <img src="https://bafybeiflnjcdsxepvpkvsmqk47ooe5kf7fbrw76rosahmapd3o6xvm7kjq.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io/" width="50" height="50"> to select the right balance for your Metaverse experience.

### Movement
You maneuver in Voxels using your keyboard and mouse. Use arrow keys or WASD for the direction you want to travel. Pressing "F" key toggles "fly" mode where you defy the laws of gravity. It also allows you to swim to the surface if you fall into the water.  

### Travelling fast 
Pressing the "Shift" key and a direction key allows you to run or fly fast.  Keep track of where you are on the map in the lower right corner of the screen.

#### Be patient. 
Sometimes the page needs time to load. If you think your computer is working too slow, the browser may be trying to catch up to a lot of movements.  **You can reload the page with F5** and it may require you to reorient your avatar.  

Voxels is still in it's early days and nothing will operate perfectly. We hope you don't get too frustrated and everything operates as planned, but remember this is not a race but an experience. There are a lot of valuable clues that will lead to a richer experience and rewards if you pay close attention.
#### Reload to [Voxels.com]((https://voxels.com)) else fails.

### Lettered and Numbered walls
The Lettered Numbered walls are located throughout the event to help players orient themselves for convenience. The numbers and letters on the walls allow palyers to find the clues easily. Write the clues down in order as they appear and as they are called for in the clues section below. 

### Swim if you fall in.
If you fall in to the water and need to get out press the F key to fly in pointing the direction you want to travel with the arrow keys. If you find yourself trapped under the parcels, look up for a separation between the large squares. Those gaps represent the streets and you will be able to fly out of the uderwater/underground. It may take a few tries and if you get frustrated you can always start again at the origin at [https://voxels.com]((https://voxels.com)) and make you wayback to the [Hub]((https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=SE@261E,3S)) or look for one of these <img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/animate.gif" height="40"> to fast-travel to [Web3Skills Hub]((https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=SE@263E,6S)) 

### "H" displays the menu.
There is a lot you can do in Voxels. Press press the "H" key for a whole menu of choices. Press the "G" key if you are adventurous and want to interact with other players.


------------------- 

### Token Gated Parcels - Access Token Required
Players will not be able to enter gated parcel without an Access Token being in your connected Web3 account. These Access Tokens are easy to get and they follow the 1155 standard on the Polygon EVM blockchain in token-speak. The Access Token are minted on the Polygon Blockchain and secured by the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a protocol that runs the Ethereum public blockchain other blockchains like Polygon to processes transactions.

There are two additional games for the Web3Skills event in MetaFest2. These two games are in-world **Treasure Hunts** where players will relocate in different parts of the Voxels world and find clues that will be entered into a final game form. **Treasure Clues 1-4** are part of the walk from the world-center in Origin City are common for both treasure hunts (there is not a CityWalk fast travel location to those of Joy and Scarlett Factory). All remainng treasure hunt clues are located in a Citywalk parcel that can be fast-travelled to from the [Web3Skills Hub](https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=SE@263E,6S) <img src="https://github.com/tenfinney/event-docs/blob/main/animate.gif" height="50"> .  

The first people to correctly submit the **Treasure Hunt** answers from the clues and submit them in the proper order will win and automatically get access to the account's rewards. 
The first person who decodes all the **Quest** clues and assembles the private key for a Web3 account will win and automatically get access to the account's rewards. 

Even if a participant is not the first person to successfully answer the clues, additional prizes will be given to second and third places. All remaining correct answers will receive a **MetaFest2 commemorative digital token** that will allow for special access to gated content.

## The MetaFest Quest Games in General
Each MetaFest2 quest has a series of games attached to it. Each colored lane represents one of the games. Some of the games are present in several quests. 

In general, the Blue lanes represent Game 1.
Orange lanes represent Game 2.
Magenta lanes represent Game 3. 
Yellow lane represents Game 4. 
Purple lane represents Game 5. 
Teal lane represents Game 6. 
Green lane represents Game 7. 
And red lane represents Game 8.

Some of the quests are designed to teach about MetaGame by collecting clues. 

For example the MetaGame Roles Quest, the blue lane represents the MetaGame **Builder** Guild. 
The orange lane is used for the **Designers** Guild.
The yellow lane is for the **Writers** Guild.
The purple lane used is for the **Shillers Marketing** Guild.
The green lane is used for the **Artists** Guild. 
The teal lane is used for the **Innkeepers** Guild. 
The magenta and red lanes are used for special quests.

None of that really matters above. It's just for reference because you can take any lane you want, and even do every lane if you want to march through the games.






=======================================
## Quest 1: 
### MetaGame Role Selection Quest 
=======================================

This will transport participants to the MetaGame role selection parcel. Start by reading the content on the walls and place special attention on the differnt guilds.  Once you have an idea about the guild and role you are interested in exploring select it from the wall.  You will be transported to the next quest location.

In this parcel, you will see a vending machine at the top of the fountain stairs. Go into the water and collect your first clue.   The vending machine is used for participants that would like to own the Web3Skills MetaFest2 Access Token. The token is not required to participate in the basic quests but is required for accessing the private gated parcels that may contain additional rewards and clues.

In this parcel there are three large video screens on the east and south walls.  Watch all three videos carefully and then answer the questions. Write you answers down in the order they are asked and you will submit the answers at the end of the quest where you started the journey at Citywalk 24 in the Main Game Center parcel. 





=======================================
## Quest 2: 
### Player's Journey Quest 
=======================================


Select the magenta "Click Here" button.  Select your colored lane. Each lane has it's own reward and participants are not competing against the other lanes but only all the participants running in the same colored lanes. 

Continue through your colored lane picking up the clues/seed words until the tour is over and you are back at Main Game Center at Citywalk 24 where you will be facing another journey. Take your time and collect the clues/seed words that will be used to assemble a Web3 address. 

Take your time and collect the clues/seed words that will be used to assemble a Web3 address. The rewards can be swept by the first player who successfully assembles the see phrase and unlocks the reward in the account.

Stay in your colored lane until you reach the video screen at 1 Citywalk parcel. Each clue is a seed word that will need to be written down and submitted in the order that it was collected.  You will find clues of the seed words in the first part of the game (colored lanes) and in the final phase of the game where you will walk among each other taking the MetaGame Player's Onboarding Journey on the east side of Origin City.

Once you have reached item A86 (after following the numbers from A1, A2, A3 ...) select the bouncing purple play button.  Not not all numbers between A1 and A86 are visible so just make sure you follow the numbers in order to find the clues. Refer to the A1-A86 location to find the clues, answer the questions, complete the objectives, and win the rewards.  

This journey requires the participants to learn as they are collecting the clues.  The participants are both playing a game and learning about how to become a better MetaGame player at the same time.  At the conclusion of the quest, one player from each colored role lane will get have all that is necessary to assemble private key. THe first winner will be the one that sweeps the rewardsfrom the Web3 account.  

All addional participants that complete the quest will receive a digital token that will grant access to Web3Skills content and a place on the Web3Skills team that onboards MetaGame players. Once the participants return to the Main Game Center at Citywalk 24 they must enter their clues into the Web3Skills Treasure Hunt 2022 form at the parcel entrance.  





=======================================
## Quest 3:
### Utopia World Tour
=======================================


Select your colored lane. Each lane has it's own reward and participants are not competing agains the other lanes but only all the participants running in the same colored lanes. Continue through your colored lane picking up the clues/seed words until the tour is over and you are back at Main Game Center at Citywalk 24 where you will be facing another journey.

### 2022 Treasure Hunt and Games for MetaFest2 sponsored by MetaGame, Web3Skills and SmartLaw.

These events are designed to show opportunities using the power or Web3 which includes private  interactions with public blockchains, token gated content, and private meeting spaces.  Some of the games and treasure hunts require reading and comprehension. The purpose is a comnbination of education and infotainment to help people better becoming acquanted and familiar with the new internet. 

The Voxels parcels used for these events can be tailored to paying customers who want a sizable presence in a metaverse without the overhead of purchasing their own metaverse parcels. This may be good for a temporary event, presentation, or for a long-term permanent interactive application. Parcel owners who provide architectural services and design services allows for everybody to get involved in the metaverse. Think of Voxels in general as a world of three dimensional websites all living together in a shared world. In individual parcels that are managed can offer a rich expansive experience as a event center that hosts different shows throughout the year. Individual parcels can be set up the same way and if they are close enbough together, they can be designed with a common theme.

Voxels parcels are also great for hosting after hour events were being physically together is impractical. After a long day at a convention you can meet up in a parcel where there are interactive activities that groups can gather, interact, play games and earn rewards.

The implication on using a metaverse in the workplace can have a posite impact on efficiency. An increase in productivity based on proxmity to contect and ease of access. Businesses that embrace the metaverse may find their productivity increasing for certain tasks because Web allows for a new style of workflow where data is freely available in a shared database where both encrypted in unencrypted information can all live together.

This goal with SmartLaw and Web3Skills working with MetaGame is to develop, host and implement practical tools for the new Internet.
